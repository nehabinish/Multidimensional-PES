The script "prepare" must be run before any use of the program to generate the
data files TOUT5D.DAT and TOUT45.DAT. Both files must be then placed in the repertory /TOUT.
This procedure uses the programs "fintmol45", "prep5D" and "prepmol45". The 
program "prep5D" requires a data file "prep5D.dat" defining the Z interval over
which the data for the 5D interpolation must be defined as well as the number of
Z pivots.

The program "testmol45" allows to calculate the potential for a given value of 
the coordinates. It is compiled by using the script "make_testmol45" and started
by typing "job testmol45".

At the beginning of each script, a section defines the location of the files.
Change the relevant argument according to the directory structure on your
computer.

Please check that the gfortran compiler is correctly set up on your computer or use another compiler.
