# Multidimensional-PES
The goal of this project is to build multidimensional potential energy surface to describe N-N2 interacting with the tungsten surfaces, specifically for the crystallographic plane W(100). The potential energy surfaces are build using an analytical model called the LEPS (London Eyring Polanyi Sato) model. Initially, the required potential energies are extracted from the numerical model called the CRP model that has been provided for the N2/W(100) system. These potential energies are then used to carry out a curve fitting to obtain the various parameters of the LEPS model. The CRP-PES also behaves as a reference model that serves to compare the quality of the LEPS- PES generated. The attained version of the program builds a 3D-PES for the N/W(100) atom- surface
